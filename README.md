# AI Tutor App

This repository contains a simple command line AI tutor application. The tutor asks a series of questions from different categories and checks your answers.

## Requirements

The script uses only the Python standard library and requires Python 3.7+.

## Usage

Run the tutor from the repository root:

```bash
python3 ai_tutor.py --list   # show categories
python3 ai_tutor.py math     # run math questions
```

If no category is provided, the app will prompt you to choose one interactively.
